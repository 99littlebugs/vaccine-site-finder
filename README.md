# NY State Vaccination :syringe: Site Tracker ![Scrape latest data](https://github.com/99littlebugs/vaccine-site-finder/workflows/Scrape%20latest%20data/badge.svg) ![Deploy](https://github.com/99littlebugs/vaccine-site-finder/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)
NY State vaccination appointments seem to be spread across multiple websites, making it challenging to see where appointments are available. 

This repository aims to solve that problem by aggregating the views of the many different sites to a single dashboard. 

## `//TODO:` :white_check_mark:
Pull requests are welcome!
1. Add all the NY state individual sites
1. Parse the addresses/location information dynamically
1. Add more private sign up websites (along with parsers to go with them)
1. Build a web front end
