      <h4>We've joined forces with <a target="_blank" href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/">NYC Vaccine List</a>!</h4>
      <p>We're working quickly to integrate the 2 sites, but in the meanwhile, feel free to check there for openings as well.</p>
      <p>This website aims to make finding a COVID-19 vaccine appointment a little bit easier. It is currently focused on
        the Nassau County, Queens, and Manhattan area and is updated with current data from these <a href="#sites">sites</a> every 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>We are a volunteer effort and not affiliated with NY State or any goverment or health agency. For feature requests, comments, or
        to help please <a href="#contact">contact us.</a></p>
      <h3>Available Appointments</h3>
      <p>The following events are showing with availability. When you click "Book" you will be brought to the NY Health
        site.</p>
      <em>The registration websites are under high load and have been generating a lot of errors. If at first you don't
        succeed, try, try again!</em>
